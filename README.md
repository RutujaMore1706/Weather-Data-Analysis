# Weather-Data-Analysis

## Problem Statement:

Understanding weather patterns and trends is crucial for various sectors such as agriculture, transportation, and tourism. This project aims to analyze a large weather dataset to identify patterns and trends over a specific time period. Additionally, the project seeks to develop a classification model to predict "Clear" weather conditions with a high level of accuracy, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on weather forecasts.

## Project Overview:

1. Data Collection: Gathered a large weather dataset covering the desired time period.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to explore the dataset, identifying patterns, trends, and correlations among different weather parameters.
4. Data Visualization: Developed data visualization dashboards using Seaborn and Plotly to provide clear and concise insights into weather patterns and trends.
5. Classification Model Development: Implemented a Decision Tree Classification model using Scikit-learn to classify weather conditions. Achieved 90% accuracy in predicting "Clear" weather condition with an 80% probability.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the classification model using appropriate metrics and techniques.
